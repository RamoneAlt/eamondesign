    <p class="phome">game jams are in short, small community held events where people are tasked with making games based around some central theme typically, and then are given a short time period (say... 1 week) to make a game with it. so here are all of my game jam submissions!</p>

    <h1 class="h1game">Art</h1>
    <p class="phome">I also have spent quite some time doing pixel art! <a href="https://www.example.com" class="aphome">You can check it out here</a>. pretty much all of my games use pixel art to some extent, so i've spent far too long honing my fair to middling art skills.</p>

    <h1 class="h1game">Gotta Ketch-Up</h1>
    <p class="phome">This was my first ever game made with unity! it was made in the span of around two weeks during the summer of 2023. i'll be honest, the art is pretty meh, the gameplay is not very well executed, but the gimmick was definitely a fairly unique one. although it's not the best, i was definitely proud of it at the time!</p>

    <h1 class="h1game">Descent To Hell</h1>
    <p class="phome">Descent to Hell is a game I made for the IcoJam 2023. It spanned 3 days, and the theme was "3...2..1." To say i had no idea what to make would be an understatement. but eventually i came up with the idea of a puzzle / platformer type game where the player has 3 total jumps, and built off of that as i went.</p>

    <h1 class="h1game">Insync</h1>
    <p class="phome">Insync was made for 2023's 1-Bit Game Jam, so I only was able to use two different colors. in Insync the player takes control of 2 different players, moving them at the same time to go through tricky puzzles and challenges. it has 23 total levels and has to be one of my favorite games i've made</p>

    <h1 class="h1game">Out o' Space</h1>
    <p class="phome">This submission to the GBJam 11 was made over the span of 10 days. the theme was space, and i was limited by the gameboy's limitations for this game! Out o' Space is a game where you have to fit oddly shaped aliens into a 12x12 grid, clearing lines and columns as you go!</p>

    <p class="phomesmall">it didn't perform the best. i recall being very busy with my schoolwork so i didn't have loads of time... but i think the game is pretty fun to play!</p>
