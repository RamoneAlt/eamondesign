    <p class="phome">game jams are in short, small community held events where people are tasked with making games based around some central theme typically, and then are given a short time period (say... 1 week) to make a game with it. so here are all of my game jam submissions!</p>

    <h1 class="h1game">Art</h1>
    <p class="phome">I also have spent quite some time doing pixel art! <a href="https://www.example.com" class="aphome" >You can check it out here</a>. pretty much all of my games use pixel art to some extent, so i've spent far too long honing my fair to middling art skills.</p>

    <h1 class="h1game">Gotta Ketch-Up</h1>
    <p class="phome">This was my first ever game made with unity! it was made in the span of around two weeks during the summer of 2023. I'll be honest, the art is pretty meh, the gameplay is not very well executed, but the gimmick was definitely a fairly unique one. although it's not the best, i was definitely proud of it at the time!</p>
